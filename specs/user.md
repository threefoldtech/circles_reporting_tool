# user

- logs in using our 3botconnect
- has unique name in the circles tool
- profile page is on https://circles.threefold.me/profile/nickolay

ofcourse circles.threefold.me needs to be replaced to the name of the instance

nickolay is the unique name as used inside the tool !

any time we refer to a user and the name is not found there is an error
